# Recipe
In this recipe project, I will be displaying my current HTML skills.
On the index page, there will be Three relative links, one named Lasagna, Ramen and Roasted Potatos.
Once clicked, you'll be redirected to the designated page where you'll see an image of the prepared dish, with a brief description underneath.
It will be followed up with the ingridients in an unordered list and the steps with an ordered list.
